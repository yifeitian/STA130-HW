    "Contrasting Descriptions of Data Distribution Visualization Methods\n",
    "1. Box Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Box plots summarize the distribution of a dataset through its five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. They are particularly useful for identifying outliers and understanding the spread of the data. Box plots clearly display the central tendency and variability, making them great for comparing distributions between groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms display the frequency distribution of a dataset by dividing it into bins (intervals). Each bin represents the count of data points falling within that range. Histograms effectively reveal the shape of the data distribution, including skewness and modality, but their appearance can be heavily influenced by the choice of bin size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Kernel Density Estimators (KDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "KDEs provide a smoothed estimate of the probability density function of a dataset. They use a kernel function to create a continuous curve that represents the underlying distribution of the data. KDE is particularly useful for visualizing data distributions when you want to avoid the blocky appearance of histograms, but it requires the selection of a bandwidth parameter, which can influence the smoothness of the resulting curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and Cons List\n",
    "Method\tPros\tCons\n",
    "Box Plot\t- Clear summary of key statistics\t- May hide the underlying data distribution\n",
    "- Easy identification of outliers\t- Less effective for small datasets\n",
    "Histogram\t- Visualizes frequency distribution clearly\t- Shape depends on bin size choice\n",
    "- Can show multiple distributions simultaneously\t- May obscure details with large bins\n",
    "KDE\t- Provides a smooth representation of data\t- Requires careful selection of bandwidth\n",
    "- Better for visualizing multimodal distributions\t- Can mislead if bandwidth is poorly chosen\n",
    "Personal Preference and Rationale\n",
    "I personally prefer box plots for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conciseness: Box plots convey a lot of information in a compact format. They provide key statistics without overwhelming the viewer.\n",
    "Outlier Detection: They clearly identify outliers, which is important for understanding data variability and potential issues.\n",
    "Comparative Clarity: When comparing multiple groups, box plots allow for quick visual comparisons of central tendencies and spreads.\n"

    "Which datasets have similar variances but quite different means?\n",

    "### Understanding the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code snippet generates samples from a gamma distribution and analyzes the mean and median:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate a Sample**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sample1 = stats.gamma(a=2, scale=2).rvs(size=1000)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line creates a random sample of 1000 data points from a gamma distribution with shape parameter \\(a=2\\) and scale parameter \\(2\\). The gamma distribution is right-skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Histogram**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   fig1 = px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({'data': sample1}), x=\"data\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line creates a histogram of the generated data using Plotly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Mean and Median**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sample1.mean()  # Calculates the mean of sample1\n",
    "   np.quantile(sample1, [0.5])  # Calculates the median of sample1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generate a Left-Skewed Sample**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   sample2 = -stats.gamma(a=2, scale=2).rvs(size=1000)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This line generates a sample from the left-skewed version of the gamma distribution by negating the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skewness and Its Effects on Mean and Median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Right Skewness**:\n",
    "- When a distribution is right-skewed (positively skewed), the tail on the right side is longer. In such cases:\n",
    "  - The **mean** is typically greater than the **median** because the mean is influenced by the higher values in the tail.\n",
    "  - Example: In the histogram of `sample1`, you will observe a peak to the left with a tail extending to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Left Skewness**:\n",
    "- When a distribution is left-skewed (negatively skewed), the tail on the left side is longer. Here:\n",
    "  - The **mean** is usually less than the **median** because the mean is affected by the lower values in the tail.\n",
    "  - Example: In the histogram of `sample2`, you will see a peak to the right with a tail extending to the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extended Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you might structure your notebook cells to demonstrate these concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cell 1: Generate Right-Skewed Sample and Histogram\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "from scipy import stats\n",
    "import plotly.express as px\n",

    "median1 = np.quantile(sample1, [0.5])\n",
    "mean1, median1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cell 2: Generate Left-Skewed Sample and Histogram\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Generate left-skewed sample\n",
    "sample2 = -stats.gamma(a=2, scale=2).rvs(size=1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create histogram\n",
    "fig2 = px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({'data': sample2}), x=\"data\")\n",

    "mean2 = sample2.mean()\n",
    "median2 = np.quantile(sample2, [0.5])\n",
    "mean2, median2\n",

    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "pd.DataFrame(results)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean vs. Median in Skewed Distributions**:\n",
    "   - In right-skewed distributions (like `sample1`), the mean is higher than the median due to the influence of high-value outliers.\n",
    "   - In left-skewed distributions (like `sample2`), the mean is lower than the median because of the impact of low-value outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Causes of Skewness**:\n",
    "   - The shape of the distribution affects the placement of the mean and median. High or low outliers pull the mean in their direction, while the median remains the middle value, thus being more robust to skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "By running the cells above, you can visualize how the mean and median behave in right and left-skewed distributions, enhancing your understanding of these statistical concepts. If you have any further questions or need additional explanations, feel free to ask!"

    "\n",
    "1. **Caloric Distribution**: The histogram may show that a significant number of fast food items contain high calorie counts, indicating that many items could contribute to high caloric intake.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation**: The scatter plots can reveal correlations between calories and total fat/sodium, suggesting that higher calorie items often have higher fat and sodium content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Restaurant Comparison**: The boxplot can highlight differences in calorie content among various fast food restaurants, showing which restaurants have items that are consistently higher or lower in calories.\n",
